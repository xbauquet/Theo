# Theo
Theo is a plugin that provides annotations for each 'dangerous android permission'.

Use
--------
Use annotations to ask for permissions

```java
@Camera
public void cameraMethod() {
    // Do something
}

@Permissions({Manifest.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION, Manifest.permission.CAMERA})
public void permissionsMethod(){
    // Do something
}
```

For the complete list of annotation see the `MainActivity` in `theo-example`

Theo also provide methods to check if permissions are granted or not

```java
Theo.checkPermission(activity, Manifest.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION);
Theo.checkPermission(activity, Manifest.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION, false);
Theo.checkPermission(activity, new String[]{Manifest.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION, Manifest.permission.CAMERA});
Theo.checkPermission(activity, new String[]{Manifest.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION, Manifest.permission.CAMERA}, false);

if(Theo.checkPermission(activity, Manifest.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION)){
    // do something
}
```
This method is returning a boolean and can be used directly inside a if().
The last boolean is used to enable or disable the snack bar that is shown if a permission is not granted.
